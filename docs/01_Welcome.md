# Welcome to the 2025 Summer School on "Introduction to Power Grid Dynamics, Stability and Control"

The Summer School consists of a five-days PhD-level course that provides to introduction to the dynamics, stability and control of power grids, suitable for PhD students at their beginning of their doctoral program in Electrical Engineering or related areas.

The course will cover fundamental concepts for the analysis of power system phenomena in steady-state and electromechanical transients, as well as analysis methods, as further described [here](./02_Course-Content.md)

The course will take place at the [Ecole Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en), located in [Ecully](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cully), which is part of the [Greater Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_of_Lyon) metropolitan area, and near [Lyon](https://en.visiterlyon.com/).
