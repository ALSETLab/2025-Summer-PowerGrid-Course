# Welcome!

## 2025 Summer School on "Introduction to Power Grid Dynamics, Stability and Control"

**Dates:** Monday June 23rd (10:00 am) to Friday 27th, 2025 (5:30 pm).

The Summer School consists of a five-days PhD-level course that provides to introduction to the dynamics, stability and control of power grids, suitable for PhD students at their beginning of their doctoral program in Electrical Engineering or related areas.

The Summer School will provide an introduction to fundamental concepts for the analysis of power system performance in steady-state (i.e., power flow) and power grid dynamics (mainly electromechanical transients), as well as analysis methods, with computer-based exercises, as further described [here](./02_Course-Content.md).

The course instructor is [Prof. Luigi Vanfretti (RPI, ECSE)](https://faculty.rpi.edu/luigi-vanfretti), and includes an invited guest lecture from [Dr. Carmen Cardozo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-cardozo/) of [Réseau de Transport d'Électricité](https://www.rte-france.com/en/home).

The course will take place at the [Ecole Centrale de Lyon (ECL)](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en), located in [Ecully](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cully), which is part of the [Greater Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_of_Lyon) metropolitan area, and near [Lyon](https://en.visiterlyon.com/). A beautiful lecture hall located at the SKYLAB of the ECL, (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4hIaQZmtjU) and [here](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en/campuses/campus-lyon-ecully/life-and-innovation-spaces-centrale-lyon) for more details and a video about this facility).

The format of the course is **in-person** and free-of-charge, as we aim to foster networking of local doctoral students in the Rhône-Alpes region and broader France that are working in topics related to electrical power grid dynamics.

**Due to space limitations of our venue, interested students must apply to register for the course, find more information [here](./05_Registration.md).**

More information about the contents of the course can be found [here](./02_Course-Content.md).
