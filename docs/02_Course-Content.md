# Content and Objectives
In today's rapidly evolving energy landscape, the stability and resilience of power grids are paramount. This School delves into the critical role of power system dynamics in maintaining grid stability and enhancing resilience against disturbances. Students will explore the fundamental principles and advanced concepts that govern the behavior of power systems under various operating conditions. Through a combination of theoretical insights, computer-based simulations and practical applications, this Summer School equips students and researchers with basic knowledge and skills necessary to build models, analyze, and control power systems for a reliable energy future. Key topics include dynamic modeling, stability analysis, control strategies, and the integration of renewable energy sources.

## Objectives
The School aims to provide students the ability to:
- Understand and reflect about stability challenges that power grids experience.
- Derive, analyze and reflect on dynamic phenomena exposed by dynamic models of synchronous machines, excitation systems, power system stabilizers (PSS).  
- To contrast and apply techniques to perform linear analysis and non-linear simulation of power systems through computer exercises.
- Understand the process of performing a simple PSS design using different software tools.
- Gain insight from industry challenges in the integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBR), such as wind and solar, and the application of High Voltage Direct Current systems for the transport of the energy that IBRs produce.

## Program
The course program can be found [here](./03_Program.md).

## Instructors
The course instructor is [Prof. Luigi Vanfretti (RPI, ECSE)](https://faculty.rpi.edu/luigi-vanfretti), and includes an invited guest lecture from [Dr. Carmen Cardozo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-cardozo/) of [Réseau de Transport d'Électricité](https://www.rte-france.com/en/home).

## Format
The School consists of a series of lectures and of (computer) exercise sessions.

For the computer exercises,  participants  should have a computer with administrative rights to install software. Simulations will be conducted with [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org/). In addition, to conduct power flow analysis and perform linear analysis and control design, one of the latest versions of MATLAB (version R2024a at least) must be installed. The following features must be available: Simulink, Control Systems Toolbox.

The format of the course is **in-person** and free-of-charge. To participate, please find more information [here](./05_Registration.md).

## Audience
This Summer School is suitable for PhD students at their beginning of their doctoral program in Electrical Engineering or related areas. 

**The course is eligible for scientific doctoral modules (+/- 20 hours)**. A certificate of attendance will be delivered to all participants after the end of the course.

Although the course targets PhD students at their initial phase of their doctorate, students conducting MSc studies or obtaining their *diplôme d'ingénieur* can also apply to participate.

To participate, please find more information [here](./05_Registration.md).
