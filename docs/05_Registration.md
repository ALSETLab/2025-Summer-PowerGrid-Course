# Registration

The course is **free of charge**, however, there is limited capacity.

Because this course aims to support the doctoral development of students at the [Ecole Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en), registration applications will be prioritized as follows:
1. Students from [Ecole Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en).
2. Students from institutions members of [Laboratoire Ampère](https://cv.hal.science/xavier-bombois-cnrs)
3. Students at French research institutions and universities.
4. Students located outside of France.

- Note: although the course targets PhD students at their initial phase of their doctorate, students conducting MSc studies or obtaining their *diplôme d'ingénieur* can also apply.
